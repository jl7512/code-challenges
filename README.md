# Codewars Code Challenges

Various code challenges I completed on Codewars

### Setup:

1. Clone the repository to your local file system

2. Install dependencies:

```
cd code-challenges
```

### Run the tests

You just run **npm test** but you need to pass in the file path to the test to run it

```
npm test -- ./xbonacci/xbonacci.test.ts
```
